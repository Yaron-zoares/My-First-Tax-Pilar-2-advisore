# Transfer Pricing Specialist Agent - Pillar Two Compliance

## Overview
The Transfer Pricing Specialist Agent is a specialized AI agent designed to provide comprehensive transfer pricing analysis and documentation for OECD Pillar Two compliance. The agent combines deep expertise in transfer pricing methodologies with Pillar Two requirements. **All validation errors have been resolved and the system is fully operational with CrewAI integration.**

## Capabilities

### 1. Transfer Pricing Analysis (`_analyze_transfer_pricing`)
- **Arm's Length Testing**: Analyzes intercompany transactions for compliance with arm's length principle
- **GloBE Income Adjustments**: Recommends adjustments to GloBE Income based on transfer pricing deviations
- **High-Risk Jurisdiction Identification**: Identifies jurisdictions with elevated transfer pricing risk
- **Documentation Mismatch Detection**: Flags inconsistencies between local TP documentation and Pillar Two reporting

### 2. OECD Guidelines Compliance (`_parse_oecd_guidelines`)
- **Chapter-by-Chapter Analysis**: Reviews compliance with OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines Chapters I-VII
- **Methodology Assessment**: Evaluates appropriateness of applied transfer pricing methodologies
- **Documentation Requirements**: Ensures completeness of transfer pricing documentation
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies gaps in OECD guideline compliance

### 3. Jurisdiction Risk Scanning (`_scan_jurisdiction_risks`)
- **Risk Factor Analysis**: Identifies transfer pricing risk factors by jurisdiction
- **Mitigation Strategy Development**: Recommends strategies for high-risk jurisdictions
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Tracks jurisdictional transfer pricing requirements
- **Audit Risk Assessment**: Evaluates likelihood of transfer pricing audits

## Risk Categories

### High Risk Jurisdictions
- **Brazil**: Complex transfer pricing rules, aggressive enforcement
- **Mexico**: TP audits, penalty regime, local file requirements
- **India**: Detailed TP rules, safe harbor provisions, audit focus
- **China**: TP documentation, local file requirements, audit intensity

### Medium Risk Jurisdictions
- **Germany**: Standard TP rules, moderate enforcement, OECD compliance
- **Netherlands**: Standard TP rules, moderate enforcement, OECD compliance
- **France**: Standard TP rules, moderate enforcement, OECD compliance

### Low Risk Jurisdictions
- **Ireland**: Standard TP rules, moderate enforcement, OECD compliance
- **Switzerland**: Standard TP rules, moderate enforcement, OECD compliance

## GloBE Income Adjustments

### Transfer Pricing Deviations
- **Arm's Length Range**: Identifies transactions outside acceptable range
- **Adjustment Calculation**: Calculates required GloBE Income adjustments
- **Documentation Requirements**: Ensures proper documentation of adjustments
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates impact on overall Pillar Two compliance

### Common Adjustment Types

## Usage Example

```python
from agents.pillar_two_master import PillarTwoMaster

# Initialize the agent
pillar_two_master = PillarTwoMaster()

# Sample entity data with transfer pricing information
entity_data = {
    "entity_name": "Sample Corp",
    "operations": ["Brazil", "Germany", "Netherlands"],
    "intercompany_transactions": [
        {
            "jurisdiction": "Brazil",
            "type": "service_fee",
            "actual_price": 1000000,
            "arm_length_range": [800000, 1200000]
        },
        {
            "jurisdiction": "Germany",
            "type": "royalty",
            "actual_price": 500000,
            "arm_length_range": [450000, 550000]
        }
    ],
    "applied_methods": ["TNMM", "CUP", "Cost Plus"]
}

# Perform transfer pricing analysis
tp_analysis = pillar_two_master._analyze_transfer_pricing(entity_data)
guidelines_compliance = pillar_two_master._parse_oecd_guidelines(entity_data)
jurisdiction_risks = pillar_two_master._scan_jurisdiction_risks(entity_data)

print("Transfer Pricing Analysis:", tp_analysis)
print("OECD Guidelines Compliance:", guidelines_compliance)
print("Jurisdiction Risk Scan:", jurisdiction_risks)
```
