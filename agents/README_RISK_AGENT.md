# Risk Assessment Agent - Pillar Two Compliance

## Overview
The Risk Assessment Agent is a specialized AI agent designed to provide comprehensive risk analysis and mitigation strategies for OECD Pillar Two compliance. **All validation errors have been resolved and the system is fully operational with CrewAI integration.**

## Capabilities

### 1. Risk Assessment (`_assess_pillar_two_risks`)
- **ETR Volatility Analysis**: Identifies entities with ETR below 12% as high risk
- **Jurisdictional Risk Assessment**: Evaluates risks in non-implementing jurisdictions
- **Compliance Risk Analysis**: Checks Safe Harbour qualification status
- **Risk Categorization**: Classifies risks as High, Medium, or Low

### 2. Compliance Monitoring (`_monitor_compliance_status`)
- **Real-time Status Tracking**: Monitors current compliance status
- **Pending Actions**: Identifies required actions for compliance
- **Regulatory Change Tracking**: Monitors regulatory developments
- **Review Scheduling**: Sets next review dates

### 3. Mitigation Planning (`_plan_mitigation_strategies`)
- **Immediate Actions**: Urgent risk mitigation steps
- **Short-term Plans**: 3-6 month implementation strategies
- **Long-term Plans**: 1-3 year strategic frameworks
- **Contingency Plans**: Backup procedures for regulatory changes

## Tools Available

### Risk_Assessor

- **Description**: Comprehensive risk assessment for Pillar Two compliance and exposure
- **Output**: Risk categorization with mitigation strategies

### Compliance_Monitor

## Risk Categories

### High Risk
- ETR below 12%
- Entity not qualified for Safe Harbour
- Jurisdictions with regulatory uncertainty

### Medium Risk

- Jurisdictions not yet implementing Pillar Two
- Compliance gaps in data collection

### Low Risk
- ETR above 15%
- Qualified Safe Harbour status
- Strong compliance framework

## Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate Actions
- Engage tax advisors for urgent review
- Prepare Top-Up Tax calculations
- Review Safe Harbour eligibility

### Short-term Plans
- Implement enhanced compliance monitoring
- Review and update tax planning strategies
- Establish risk assessment procedures

### Long-term Plans
- Develop comprehensive Pillar Two compliance framework
- Establish regular risk assessment procedures
- Create automated compliance monitoring

### Contingency Plans
- Prepare for regulatory changes
- Establish backup compliance procedures
- Develop crisis management protocols

## Usage Example

```python
from agents.pillar_two_master import PillarTwoMaster

# Initialize the agent
pillar_two_master = PillarTwoMaster()

# Sample entity data
entity_data = {
    "entity_name": "Sample Corp",
    "etr": 10.5,
    "jurisdiction": "Brazil",
    "qualified_status": False,
    "safe_harbour": False
}

# Perform risk assessment
risk_analysis = pillar_two_master._assess_pillar_two_risks(entity_data)
compliance_status = pillar_two_master._monitor_compliance_status(entity_data)
mitigation_plans = pillar_two_master._plan_mitigation_strategies(entity_data)

print("Risk Assessment:", risk_analysis)
print("Compliance Status:", compliance_status)
print("Mitigation Plans:", mitigation_plans)
```

## Integration with Crew

The Risk Assessment Agent is integrated into the Pillar Two Crew with the following task:

```yaml
- name: "risk_assessment"
  description: "Comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation planning"
  agent: "risk_analyst"
  expected_output: "Risk assessment report with mitigation strategies"
```

## Configuration

The agent is configured in `crew_config.yaml`:

```yaml
- name: "risk_analyst"
  role: "Risk Assessment and Mitigation Specialist"
  goal: "Comprehensive risk analysis and mitigation strategies for Pillar Two compliance"
  tools:
    - risk_assessor
    - compliance_monitor
    - mitigation_planner
```

## Benefits

1. **Proactive Risk Management**: Identifies risks before they become compliance issues
2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Covers ETR, jurisdictional, and compliance risks
3. **Actionable Strategies**: Provides specific mitigation steps
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Tracks compliance status continuously
5. **Regulatory Adaptability**: Responds to regulatory changes

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning for risk prediction
- Integration with external regulatory databases
- Automated compliance reporting
- Real-time regulatory change alerts
- Advanced scenario modeling
